On-Boarding User Guide
======================

Target Users
============
Modelers

Overview
========

Acumos accommodates the use of a wide range of tools and  technologies in the development of machine learning models, including support for both open source and proprietary toolkits. Models can be easily onboarded and wrapped into containerized microservices which are interoperable with many other components. On-boarding provides an ingestion interface for various  types of models to enter the Acumos Machine Learning (ML) platform. Examples  of models include well-defined objects such as scikit-learn estimators, TensorFlow weights, and arbitrary R functions.

The solution for accommodating a myriad of different model types is to provide a custom wrapping library for each runtime. The client library encapsulates the complexity surrounding the serialization and deserialization of models. Additionally, the client library creates a common native interface, a wrapper, for invoking the inner model. In order for Acumos to be able to reason about models uniformly, there is a common model interface description that details what the available  model methods are and what they look like. Acumos instantiates ML models as microservices and safely composes them together.

The Acumos on-boarding process generates everything needed to create an executable microservice for your model and add it to the catalog.  Acumos uses Protobuf as a language-agnostic data format to provide a common description of the model data inputs and outputs.

The appropriate client library does the first step of the on-boarding process. This includes:

#) Introspection to assess the toolkit library versions and determine file types
#) Creation of a JSON description of the system
#) Creation of the protobuf file
#) File push to the Acumos on-boarding server


Methods and Semantics
---------------------

Acumos is a machine learning platform, thus we need to provide certain “methods” in our wrapped models that Acumos can invoke in order to support various workflows. In a machine learning setting, these methods might look like:

- fit(message) -> model state

    - Does a full “batch” fit, replacing previous internal model parameters
    - Returns a “model state” object that provides a standard serialization method

- partial_fit(message) -> model state

    - Does a partial fit, updating internal model parameters
    - Returns a “model state” object that provides a standard serialization method

- transform(message) -> message

    - Returns an object that provides a standard serialization method


Architecture
============
High-level flow:

.. image:: images/onboarding/UseCase.png

In the illustrations below, custom transformation functions which consume and produce a native DataFrame are converted to standardized native models. The  transforms are then composed together in Acumos as microservices. This illustration begs the question of how the DataFrame can be  represented abstractly in order to validate this workflow.

On-Boarding a Python Model
==========================
The Acumos Python Client library is required for users who want to push their TensorFlow and scikit-learn models to the Acumos Portal. You will use this library for on-boarding all your models. The library creates meta-data by introspection, packages all the necessary information, and then uploads it to Acumos On-Boarding server. The Acumos Python Client library is packaged and available on PyPI. Please see the `PyPI <https://pypi.org/project/acumos/>`_ for instructions and a tutorial.

On-Boarding an R Model
======================
Prerequisites
-------------
Before you begin:

#) You must have protobuf 3 installed. Please visit the protobuf repository for more information on how to install protoc. Install version 3 (version 2 will not work).
#) Your onboarding url is:   XYZ .  Use this url in place of the default url:

.. code-block:: bash

    api='http://localhost:8887/v2/models', name='(undefined)'


Installing the Acumos R Client
------------------------------
The  install package is available here:

.. code-block:: bash

    install.packages("acumos",,c("http://r.research.att.com","http://rforge.net"))


You need to install all dependent packages from CRAN first.

Using the Acumos R Client
-------------------------

Creating a Component
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To create a deployment component, use acumos::compose() with the functions to expose. If type specs are not defined, they default to c(x="character").
The component consists of component.json defining the component and its metadata, component.bin the binary payload and component.proto with the protobuf specs.
Please consult R documentation page for details, i.e., use ?compose in R or see the `Compose <http://www.rforge.net/doc/packages/acumos/compose.html>`_ page at RForge.

Deploying a Component
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 
To run the component you have to create a runtime.json file with at least {"input_port":8100} or similar to define which port the component should listen to. If there are output components there should also be a "output_url" entry to specify where to send the result to. It can be either a single entry or a list if the results are to be sent to multiple components. Example:

.. code-block:: bash

    {"input_port":8100, "output_url":"http://127.0.0.1:8101/predict"}


With the component files plus runtime.json in place, the component can be run using

.. code-block:: bash

    R -e 'acumos:::run()'


The run() function can be configured to set the component directory and/or locations of the component files if needed. If you don't want to create a file, the runtime parameter also accepts the runtime structure, so you can also use

.. code-block:: bash

    R -e 'acumos:::run(runtime=list(input_port=8100, output_url="http://127.0.0.1:8101/predict"))'


Details: ?run in R or see the `Run <http://www.rforge.net/doc/packages/acumos/run.html>`_ page at RForge.


On-Boarding H2o.ai and Generic Java Models
==========================================

The Acumos Java Client Library command line utility is used to on-board H2o.ai and Generic Java models. This library creates artifacts from an H2o or Generic Java model and pushes the artifacts to the on-boarding server for the H2o Model runner to be able to use them.

High-Level Flow
---------------

#) The Modeler creates a model in H2o and exports it in the MOJO model format (.zip file) using any interface (eg.Python, Flow, R) provided by H2o. For Generic Java, the Modeler creates a model and exports it in the .jar format.
#) The Modeler runs the JavaClient jar, which creates a Protobuf (default.proto) file for the Model, creates the required metadata.json file and an artifact called modelpackage.zip.
#) Depending on the choice of the Modeler, she can manually upload these generated artifacts to the Acumos Marketplace via its Web interface. This is Web-based on-boarding. We will see how to do this in this article.
#) Or the Java client library itself, on-boards the model onto the on-boarding server if the modeler provides the on-boarding server URL. This is CLI-based on-boarding.

The Model Runner the Model Runner provides a wrapper around the ML model, packages it as a containerized microservice and exposes a predict method as a REST endpoint. When the model is onboarded and deployed, this method (REST endpoint) can then be called by other external applications to request predictions off of the model.


Prerequisities
--------------

- Java 1.8
- The `Java Client <https://nexus.acumos.org/#nexus-search;quick~java-client>`_ jar file
- The `H2o Generic Model Runner <https://nexus.acumos.org/#nexus-search;h2o-genericjava-modelrunner>`_


Preparing to On-Board your H2o or a Generic Java Model
------------------------------------------------------

Place JavaClient.jar in one folder locally. This is the folder from which you intend to run the jar. After the jar runs, the created artifacts will also be available in this folder. You will use some of these artifacts if you are doing Web-based onboarding. We will see this later. Create an additional supporting folder which will contain all that the JavaClient.jar needs to run. It will contain:

#) Models - In case of H2o, your model will be a MOJO zip file. In case of Generic Java, your model will be .jar file. We have included sample models for you to play around with.
#) Protobuf compiler for java version 3.4.0 - Download `protobuf-java-3.4.0.jar <http://central.maven.org/maven2/com/google/protobuf/protobuf-java/3.4.0/>`_ and place it in this folder.
#) Model runner or Service jar - For H2o rename h2o-genericjava-modelrunner.jar obtained from the 1st section to abcService.jar if your model name is abc. Place it in this folder. Rename the jar as GenericModelService.jar for Generic Java onboarding
#) csv file used for training the model - Place the csv file (with header having the same column names used for training) you used for training the model here. This is used for autogenerating the .proto file. If you don't have the .proto file, you will have to supply the .proto file yourself in the supporting folder. Make sure you name it default.proto
#) default.proto - This is only needed if you don't have the csv file used to train the model. In this case, Java Client cannot autogenerate the .proto file. You will have to supply the .proto file yourself in the supporting folder. Make sure you name it default.proto Also make sure, the default.proto file for the model is in the following format. You need to appropriately replace the data and datatypes under DataFrameRow and Prediction according to your model. See the code block below.
#) application.properties file - Pass the port number on which the service should run in this file
#) modelConfig.properties - Add this file only in case of Generic Java model onboarding. This file contains the modelMethod and modelClassName of the model.
#) ModelConfig.properties : Only needed if you are on-boarding a Generic Java model


.. code-block::

   syntax = "proto3";
   option java_package = "com.google.protobuf";
   option java_outer_classname = "DatasetProto";

   message DataFrameRow {
     string sepal_len = 1;
     string sepal_wid = 2;
     string petal_len = 3;
     string petal_wid = 4;
   }

   message DataFrame {
        repeated DataFrameRow rows = 1;
   }
   message Prediction {
        repeated string prediction= 1;
   }

   service Model {
     rpc transform (DataFrame) returns (Prediction);
   }

Example On-Boarding and Folder Structure
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

1. I place my Javaclient.jar in /home/deven/tryoutjavaclient/ folder. This is where I intend to run the jar from. After the jar runs, the created artifacts will also be available in this folder.


.. image:: images/java-client/before_running_javaclient.PNG


2. I prepare a supporting folder /home/deven/mojoprinter2/all-models like so. It has everything I need to on-board my java model.
In this case, I am on-boarding samplemodel.zip which is a K-means Clustering H2o model which does partitioning of a large calls dataset.


.. image:: images/java-client/supporting_folder.PNG


3. I intend to do Web-based on-boarding for my H2o model called samplemodel.zip. And I intend to use the proto file autogeneration capabilities of the Java client.
So I also pass along the csv file I used to train it. The sample command looks like this:


.. image:: images/java-client/running_the_java_client.PNG


4. Now I go back to /home/deven/tryoutjavaclient/ (i.e from where I ran the Java client) to find the generated artifacts. I will now manually upload the metadata.json file, modelpackage.zip and the default.proto file to the web interface of the marketplace.


.. image:: images/java-client/after_running_java_client.PNG



Pushing to the Acumos Portal
----------------------------

If you use Web-based on-boarding:

#) After you run the client, you will see a modeldump.zip file generated in the same folder where we ran the Java Client for
#) Upload this file in the Portal UI
#) Enter the model's name. This name should be same as the one you named it when running the jar.
#) You will be able to see a success method in the Web interface.

If you use CLI-based on-boarding, you don't need to perform the steps outlined just above. The Java client will do it for you. The needed TOSCA artifacts and docker images are produced, and the model is published to the marketplace. You will see a message in the terminal that tells you it was on-boarded succesfully.

You and your teammates can now see, rate, review, comment, collaborate on your model in the Acumos Marketplace. When requested and deployed by a user, your model runs as a dockerized microservice on the infrastructure of your choice and exposes a predict method as a REST endpoint. This method can be called by other external applications to request predictions off of your model.


Addendum : Creating a model in H2o
----------------------------------
You must have H2o 3.14.0.2 installed on your machine. For instructions on how to install visit the H2o `download page <https://www.h2o.ai/download/>`_.

H2o provides different interfaces to create models and use H2o for eg. Python, Flow GUI, R, etc.
As an example, below we show how to create a model using the Python innterface of H2o and also using the H2o Flow GUI. You can use the other interfaces too which have comparable functions to train a model and download the model in a MOJO format.

Here is a sample H2o iris example program that shows how a model can be created and downloaded as a MOJO using the Python Interface:

.. code-block:: python

   import h2o
   import pandas as pd
   import numpy as np
   import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
   import seaborn as sns

   # for jupyter notebook plotting,
   %matplotlib inline
   sns.set_context("notebook")

   h2o.init()

   package/inst/extdata/iris_wheader.csv')

   Iris data set description
   -------------------------
   1. sepal length in cm
   2. sepal width in cm
   3. petal length in cm
   4. petal width in cm
   5. class:
       Iris Setosa
       Iris Versicolour
       Iris Virginica


   iris.head()
   iris.describe()
   # training parameters
   training_columns = ['sepal_len', 'sepal_wid', 'petal_len', 'petal_wid']
   #  response parameter
   response_column = 'class'

   # Split data into train and testing
   train, test = iris.split_frame(ratios=[0.8])
   train.describe()
   test.describe()

   from h2o.estimators import H2ORandomForestEstimator
   model = H2ORandomForestEstimator(ntrees=50, max_depth=20, nfolds=10)

   # Train model
   model.train(x=training_columns, y=response_column, training_frame=train)

   print (model)

   # Model performance
   performance = model.model_performance(test_data=test)
   print (performance)

   # Download the model in MOJO format. Also download the h2o-genmodel.jar file
   modelfile = model.download_mojo(path="/home/deven/Desktop/", get_genmodel_jar=True)

   predictions=model.predict(test)
   predictions

Here is a sample H2o iris example program that shows how a model can be created and downloaded as a MOJO using the H2o Flow GUI.
