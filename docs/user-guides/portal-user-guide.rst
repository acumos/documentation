Portal and Marketplace User Guide
=================================

Introduction
============

The Portal is a web-based tool designed for users who wish to either explore and use
machine learning models or data scientists who build models and wish to
share them with a larger community. 

The Acumos Portal has two sections: (1) The Marketplace and associated
tools for people wishing to find, learn about and use (deploy or
download) models in their own computing environments; and (2) the
Modeler sections for people wishing to share, describe and market their
models. Modeler tools are available in several areas of the site, including
Onboarding, the Design Studio, My Models, and Manage My Model.

The Marketplace and Modeler communities may communicate and interact via the
commenting and rating tools for users.


It has the following key features:

    #. Easy Onboarding of Models. The Acumos Portal enables modelers to
       easily onboard their AI models, document them, and package them into
       reusable microservices. Newly onboarded models are located in the
       PRIVATE/UNPUBLISHED catalog, viewable only by the user. The Modeler
       may publish them to either their Company marketplace (viewable by
       others with logins on their local Acumos instance) or to the PUBLIC
       Marketplace, where they may be distributed to a wider community.

    #. Explore the Possibilities of AI. The Marketplace enables users to
       explore, gathering high-level or detailed information about a model
       and how it is used. Users have access to extensive documentation, as
       well as ratings and comments from the greater community.

    #. Model Packaging. Models are packaged as Dockerized microservices so
       they can be deployed directly to a variety of environments. As a part
       of the onboarding process, protobuf files are created to describe the model
       inputs and outputs in a standard format, and a TOSCA file is generated
       to allow the model to be accessed in the Design Studio.

    #. Model Access. Once a model is selected, the Acumos Marketplace
       provides access to that model, either via downloading or by deploying
       it to any one of several commonly used cloud environments. Specialty
       access may be available on some instances. For example, models may be
       specifically designed to work on ONAP instances.

    #. Compose. Users may also work with models in the Design Studio,
       chaining them together to create new custom composite models to help
       solve specific business problems. These composite models can be saved
       and managed (validated, deployed, published) just like simple models.
       
    #. Federation. The Acumos Marketplace supports distributed relationships
       with other Acumos peer instances, allowing users to browse and procure
       models from remote federated partners. Federation also creates a much 
       larger available user pool for data scientists to share their models.

    #. Training. Acumos provides methods to train models. Data sources can
       be discovered and training process can be designed in the Acumos
       Training Studio. (This work is in progress and not available in
       release 1.0.)

Acumos Home
===========

Users are welcomed to Acumos on the home page, showing a carousel
highlighting Acumos features and uses. Other parts of the page show
featured or trending models, upcoming Acumos events and illustrations of
how Acumos can help customize solutions in many domains.

Note: Users do not need to be logged into Acumos or have an account to see the
Home and Marketplace pages but users must be logged in to download or deploy models.

Acumos Marketplace - For Consumers
==================================

The Acumos Marketplace is designed to make it easy to discover, explore,
and use AI models. In addition to displaying models from the local platform's catalog, the Public Markeplace can be configured to display models from peer Public Marketplaces. Users may view the details of a peer Model. However, users aren't able to work with, download, or deploy a peer Model without first requesting access to use that model. Public Marketplace peer relationships are set up and managed by the administrators of each Acumos instance. 


The Marketplace has three main views: 

- Company: The Company Marketplace only shows models which have been onboarded by local users and published to the local marketplace catalog
- Public: Models in the Public Marketplace are visible to all Acumos instances with a peer relationship
- ALL:  This choice displays models in both the user's Company and Public Marketplace

After you have used models on the Marketplace, you can share your experiences by using the comments and ratings capabilities on the Marketplace. 


Searching by Keyword for Models
-------------------------------

To search the Marketplace by keywords, follow these steps:

#. From the Main Menu, click on the Marketplace tab on the left so the
   Marketplace menu appears
#. Fill in the keyword search on the top left inner menu

.. _viewing-model-details:
Viewing Model Details
---------------------
Much more information about a model is available on a Model Details page. From the search results, clicking on any model image shows the Model Detail page for that model. Sections on the Model Detail page include:

- Introduction
- Ratings
- Comments
- Signatures:  the description of the model incoming data feed and output
- Documents: any supporting documentation the Modeler wishes to include
- Version History 

Most of the information on the detail page is contributed by the creator of the model to showcase the model and tell potential users about its capabilities and use. Ratings and Comments are contributed by other users of this model.  

Downloading a Model
-------------------

Logged-in users may download a model bundle from the Model Detail page.

    .. image:: images/portal/models_downloadFromMPJourney.png

Acumos Portal - For Modelers
============================

The Acumos Portal is designed to enable Modelers to easily onboard,
document, and package their AI models into reusable microservices.

A Modeler may test out the Acumos features in a personal
**private/unpublished** section of the Marketplace. Additionally, a Modeler may publish
the models to the Company Marketplace or to the Public Marketplace for wider distribution.

Modelers are typically subject-matter experts in their fields, so Acumos
models come from a wide range of domains and applications.

Models may be written in a number of popular programming languages or
toolkits, including TensorFlow and R.

Overview for Modelers
---------------------

All of the models that a user has onboarded can be viewed from the **My
Models** Page. Depending on their history, the models may exist in one
for four sections: MY UNPUBLISHED MODELS, MY MODELS: PUBLISHED TO COMPANY MARKETPLACE,
MY MODELS: PUBLISHED TO PUBLIC MARKETPLACE, and MY DELETED MODELS    .

Models published to Company are visible only to account holders on 
your local Acumos instance. This can be thought of as “inside the instance firewall” – typically viewable by
close collaborators. Models published to Public are available to outside
Acumos instances. The set of peers that may have access to Public models
is determined by your local Administrator.

Private/Unpublished models are visible only to the Modeler. However, a Modeler does
have the option to share a model with a specific user who has an account
on the same Acumos instance.

Onboarding Models
------------------

The Acumos onboarding process generates everything needed to create an executable microservice for your model and add it to the catalog.  Acumos uses Protobuf as a language-agnostic data format to provide a common description of the model data inputs and outputs. Any user may onboard a new model to their Company Aucmos instance. Users
can reach the Onboarding page from HOME, MARKETPLACE or side navigation.

A high-level summary of the onboarding steps and overview of the
workflow is shown below. 

    .. image:: images/portal/models_onboardingJourney.png
       :width: 4.74167in
       :height: 5.24375in

The onboarding process via web is accomplished by the following steps:

#. From the On-Boarding tab in the left navigation, or from My Models
   page, select **Add New Model**
#. Select Web On-boarding
#. Complete all the user steps to onboard your model, including:

    #. Choose Toolkit
    #. Select **Download client library**
    #. Select **Upload Model Bundle** and drag your file from the local
      machine to the screen and select **Done**
    #. Add a name for your model using the pencil icon
    #. All the steps have been done (you will see the number for each
      converted to a green check mark), the **Add to Catalog** button
      will be enabled
    #. Select **Add to Catalog.** This will initiate a series of back end
      process steps, illuminated as they run, by the cascade from left
      to right of the icons on the top of the page. These include
      uploading the model and artefacts, creating the microservice that
      will run in a docker container, creating a tosca file for your
      model so it can be used in the design studio, storing the
      artefacts and model and creating the link so you can access your
      model in the **private/unpublished** section of your personal
      catalog

    .. image:: images/portal/models_onboardingWeb.png
       :width: 4.94306in
       :height: 3.08125in


My Models Page
--------------

Users may view all the models they have uploaded by accessing the My
Models page.

Models are organized by their visibility to others on your **My Models**
page. They are sorted into the following sections: 

**MY UNPUBLISHED MODELS**
    Initially, successfully onboarded model will appear in my Models page in
    the UNPUBLISHED section. These are visible only to you and any
    collaborators of that model (shared). Partially onboarded models (in
    process) are also displayed in this section but are shown greyed out
    until the onboarding process is successfully completed.

**MY MODELS: PUBLISHED TO COMPANY MARKETPLACE**
    Models that have been published to Local, appear in the the LOCAL
    marketplace and are visible to anyone with an account on the local
    Acumos Instance.

**MY MODELS: PUBLISHED TO PUBLIC MARKETPLACE**
    Models that have been published to Public, appear in the the PUBLIC
    marketplace and may be viewed by users on Acumos instances that have a
    federated relationship with your local instance.

**MY DELETED MODELS**
    Initially, successfully onboarded model will appear in my Models page in
    the UNPUBLISHED section. These are visible only to the owner of that
    model and any collaborators of that model (via the "Share Model"
    process). Partially onboarded models (in process) are also displayed in
    this section but are shown greyed out until the onboarding process is
    successfully completed.

Clicking on any model image shows the Model Detail page for that model. 
Managing Your Model
-------------------
If a model has not been published, the Model Detail page may not show
very much information. To add a description, documents and details from the My Models page, click on any model image to show the Model Detail page for that model. From the Model Detail Page, click on the Manage My Model button at the top. A new page loads with MANAGEMENT OPTIONS on the left.


Share Model with Team
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Modeler can share a model with anyone who has an account on his/her local
Acumos. When you share a model with a collaborator, you make that Modeler a
co-owner of the model. This means they have all the same capabilities as
the original owner. An overview is shown below.

    .. image:: images/portal/models_shareWithTeamJourney.png
       :width: 6.48819in
       :height: 3.98403in

The steps to share are as follows:

1. First, select the "Share with Team" tab under "MANAGEMENT OPTIONS"

    .. image:: images/portal/models_shareWithTeamTab.png
       :width: 4.26806in
       :height: 2.02778in

2. Next, where you see "find a user to share with", type in the user ID
   of the person you wish to share with - you will need to get that user
   ID from them. The UI will show suggestions, based on the characters
   you have typed. Once you have located the correct person, select the
   SHARE button

    .. image:: images/portal/models_shareWithTeamScreen.png
       :width: 1.09028in
       :height: 1.80069in

3. Finally, the Sharing Popup will disappear and you can see that your
   model is shared and you have added them as a collaborator for that
   model. Click on each icon to see who you are currently sharing a
   model with

    .. image:: images/portal/models_shareWithTeamDone.png
       :width: 3.81736in
       :height: 2.16111in

The new collaborator will receive a notification that a new model has
been shared with him/her.

If you wish to remove the sharing rights from someone, simply click on
the small "X" next to his/her icon.

Publishing a Model 
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Users may distribute their model by publishing it to either their 
Company Marketplace or to the Public Marketplace.

The presentation of the model may be different in each marketplace to
meet the needs of the different communities. For example, a user may
wish to provide company-specific details to their colleagues inside
their Company instance. This may include proprietary information,
documents or details that are only relevant to colleagues using the
Company instance. Information published to Company is contained within the
company firewall.

The Modeler may wish to present their model to the Public Marketplace in a more
general way, so it can be discovered and adapted for use by others.

Acumos provides two separate publishing workflows to meet this need.

There is a facility to simply use the same information if the publication information is the same for both marketplaces. . Also, publishing to
either marketplace can be done in any order. There is no requirement to
publish first to the Company marketplace. The same model can appear in
both catalogs.

Publishing to Company Marketplace
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The publishing process is summarized here.

    .. image:: images/portal/models_publishLocalJourney.png
       :width: 6.17014in
       :height: 3.81528in

Specific steps:

#. From the **My Models** page, select the model of interest, open the
   **Model Detail Page** and click on **Manage My Model** at the top
#. Select Publish to Company Marketplace
#. Click on Model Description and describe your model in terms that your
   users will understand and wish to use it
#. Click on Model Category. Select a Category and Toolkit type from the
   dropdown box
#. Select Model Documents and add any useful documents, such as release
   notes or detailed instructions that will help your users
#. Click on Model Tags. Either select one of the system tags or add your
   own. Any tags you add will become available for other users to select
   as well
#. You have completed the first step for publishing. Now click on
   **Submit for Publication**. This will launch a series of back end
   steps that will prepare your model for publication
#. The publishing workflow consists of several steps including checking
   for licences, and running a keyword and security scan. Some instances
   may require manual review
#. Once the publishing process is complete, all the workflow icons will
   be highlighted and the model will be available in the Company
   Marketplace

    .. image:: images/portal/models_publishLocalSteps.png
       :width: 5.24583in
       :height: 3.24306in

Publish to Public Marketplace
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Publishing to the Public Marketplace follows the same steps as Publish
to Company Marketplace.

The description and documentation may be different, as needed for a
different audience. If you wish to use the same presentation for the
Public model that you have previously published to Company, use the
checkbox to select that.

The Publishing back end process may be different for publishing to
Public. The required publication steps for each instance are configured
by the local Administrator.


Acumos Composition: Design Studio
=================================

The Design Studio is used to chain together multiple models,
along with data translation tools, filters and output adapters,
into a full end-to-end solution which can then be deployed into
any runtime environment.

An overview of the user journey for the Design Studio is shown below.

    .. image:: images/portal/models_compositeDesignStudioJourney.png
       :width: 6.49583in
       :height: 4.85833in

Architecture
------------

ML Models are the basic building blocks in the Design Studio. It is these models that are combined together by the designer to create complex ML application – aka composite solutions. 

ML Models – Isolated and Standalone
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

ML Models are developed and contributed by ML subject matter experts. They may be written in any programming language and may have been developed in any toolkit – Scikit, Tensor Flow, R, H2O, etc.

The model developer may not necessarily be aware of the existence of other models. The models are usually standalone entities. They offer a standard contract – an interface definition to the external world. This contract specifies the details of the operation performed by the model, the input request (message) consumed by the model and the output response (message) produced by the model. In Acumos, this contract is specified in the Protobuf file.

ML Models – Ports, Requirements and Capabilities
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each ML Model may support one or more operations – corresponding to the functions, such as “prediction”, “classification”, etc. performed by the model. Each operation consumes an input message and produces an output message. The message signatures are specified in the Protobuf file.

Each operation is represented by two ports – an input port and an output port. An ML model may have more than two ports, if it provides (exposes) multiple operations (aka services).

#.    Input Port - consumes the input message and provides the service, such as prediction or classification or regression to the caller/client. The input port represents the capability of the model. The client that need a service to be performed need to send a request to input or the capability port of the model.
#.    Output Port – produces the output (response) message. Note that the output produced by an operation (say the Prediction message) need not necessarily be consumed by the caller/client, but in fact needs to be fed to another ML Model which provides another service, such as classification (of the Prediction message). So from a composition perspective, the output port represents a requirement that is satisfied by classification service.


Model Ingestion in the Design Studio
------------------------------------

How to Ingest ML Models in Design Studio
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to ingest the onboarded ML Models into the Design Studio, the following steps must be performed:

#) The models must be on boarded via on boarding mechanism along with their Protobuf files or when the model were on boarded their Protobuf files should have auto generated.

#) The Protobuf files should have both the service specification and the message specifications.

#) The service specification of the Protobuf file should have the complete operation signature(s) listed in them – such as the:

    #) Type of the operation -- rpc, etc
    #) Name of the operation
    #) Input message name
    #) Output message name

#) Each input and output messages should have their message signatures listed, and each field type should be basic Protobuf data type.

#) After the models have been successfully on boarded, the modeler must login to the Acumos Market Place Portal, in order to classify the uploaded model into one of model categories – currently four categories are supported in Design Studio – Classification, Prediction, Regression and Other.

#) In order to classify the on boarded model into one of the four categories above, the modeler needs to:

    #) Go to the “My Models” in Market Place
    #) Click on the newly on boarded model
    #) Click on “Manage My Models”
    #) Click on “Publish to Company Marketplace”
    #) Click on “Model Category”
    #) Select the appropriate model category and the toolkit type
    #) Click Done

#) The model would now appear in the “Models” (left hand side) palette of the Design Studio under the appropriate category. The model is now available to be dragged and dropped in the Design Studio canvas.


Files Generated for Design Studio
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Once the models have been onboarded, the Protobuf files associated with the model is used to generate Protbuf.json and TGIF.json files

Protobuf.json File
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

This is an intermediary file used to represent the Protobuf.proto file in JSON format. It is used for the generation of TGIF.json file.

TGIF.json File
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The TGIF.json file represents an ML Model in the Design Studio. Every model should have a TGIF.json file associated with it to allow the model to be represented in the Design Studio, dragged and dropped in the Canvas and to allow the model to be composed with another model – based on composition rules (explained next).

The TGIF.json file contains these critical pieces of information:

#)    **Self** – section: This section describes the name and version of the ML model which is displayed on the Design Studio Web UI.
#)    **Services.provides** – section: This section provides a list of services offered by the ML Model. At present only the name of the operation and JSON representation of its input messages is included here. The information provided in Services.provides and Services.calls section is used for determining the composability of a pair of output and input ports of the ML Models.
#)    **Services.calls** – section: This section provides a list of output messages of the services offered by the ML Model. As explained earlier, these output messages are consumed by the services provided by other ML Model(s). The name of the operation (same as provided in Services.provides) and JSON representation of its output messages is included here. The information provided in Services.provides and Services.calls section is used for determining the composability of a pair of output and input ports of the ML Models.
#)    **Artifacts. Uri** – section: This section contains the location of the docker image of the ML Model. This information is used by the Blueprint file to retrieve the docker image of the model in order to deploy it in cloud. 


Model Composition in the Design Studio
--------------------------------------

The main function of the Design Studio is to compose the ML Models to produce a meaningful application.

Criterion for Model Composition
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Currently the Design Studio implements a simple model composition strategy based on matching the output message of the output port of one ML Model to the input message of the input port of another ML Model.

In the Design Studio a pair of ports are compatible if the requirement of one port can be matched with the capability of another port. Or if the output of one model can be consumed by the input port of another model so as to get some service from the latter.

The matching criterion is based on comparing the Protobuf message signature of the output port to the message signature of the input port of another model.

A pair of output and input messages are compatible if all the following conditions are satisfied:

#) The number of tags in both their message signatures is the same
#) For each tag number, the fields on both the sides are of the same type
#) For each tag number, the fields on both the sides have the same role – repeated, optional, etc. 

NOTE: the field names are not taken into consideration for determining compatibility.

A pair of output and input ports are compatible, if all the following conditions are satisfied:

#) They both produce and consume identical number of messages
#) Each message on one side is compatible with another message on another side, as per the compatibility definition given above

NOTE: the message names are not taken into consideration for determining the compatibility.


Design Studio User Interface – A Tour
-------------------------------------

The Design Studio UI, shown below, consists of a Design Canvas with a grid background in the center flanked on left and right hand side by the Models & Solutions Catalog Palette and the Properties & Matching Model Palette. At the bottom of the Design Canvas is the Validation Console. At the top are the New, Clear, Validate, and Save buttons.

1. Models Tab: Displays the catalog of the ML Models – the basic building blocks used for creating composite solutions. The models are currently classified under four categories – Classification, Prediction, Regression and Others. 

2. Solutions Tab: Displays the catalog of composite solutions (built out of basic building blocks) that have either Public or Company visibility. 

3. Data Transformation Tools: A set of useful data transformation utilities are displayed here. Currently there is a Data Mapper which performs mapping between some basic Protobuf data types, such as int32, string, float, double and bool. An Aggregator is another utility that is planned to be deployed there.

4. Data Sources: This section is meant to represent data sources which feed the ML Models. It could be any entity that produces data that is consumed by ML Models and Data Transformation Tools, such Data Lakes, Databases, Cell Towers, Network elements which produce data such as Routers, Switches, etc. 


5. Properties Tab: Displays the properties of elements – such as ML Models and Messages inside the Ports. If an ML Model is selected by the user in the Design Canvas, it displays the name, type, owner, provider and tool kit type information. If a Message inside the ML port is selected by the user, it displays the Protobuf message signature – such as the fields of the message, their name, type, tag and role (repeated, optional etc.)

6. Matching Models Tab:    If a requirement (output) port of an ML Model is selected in the Design Canvas, then this tab shows a list of all models that have matching capabilities (in their input ports). The user can then drag the desired model in the Design Canvas and connect the output port to the input port. If a capability (input) port of an ML Model is selected in the Design Canvas, then this tab shows a list of all models that have matching requirements (in their output ports). 

7. My Solutions: Displays the catalog of composite solutions (built out of basic building blocks) that are marked “Private” to the logged in user. When the user clicks on an existing solution, that solution is displayed in the Design Canvas. The user can then make modification to the solution and save it as a separate solution by providing a new name or new version or both.

8. New:    The user clicks this button to create a new composite solution.

9. Clear: The user clicks this button to clear an unsaved solution. 

10. Save: The user clicks this button to save a new composite solution or save changes to an existing solution. The user is prompted to provide the name, version and a description of the solution. The user can make modification to the solution and save it as a separate solution by providing a new name or new version or both. 

11. Validate: The user clicks this button to validate a composite solution created in the Design Canvas. Both the success and error messages are displayed in the Validation Console. If the solution is valid then a Blueprint.json file is created which is used to deploy the solution in the target cloud. 

12. Design Canvas: This is where the users drags one or more ML Models – the basic building blocks to create a composite solution or if the user clicks on an existing solution in Solutions or My Solutions tab, it is displayed in the Design Canvas. 



Ports of the Model
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A model may have multiple ports. A Requirement (output) port is represented by a filled-in circle and a Capability (input) port is represented by an empty circle. The matching pair of ports are represented by identical icons inside their ports, such as diamonds, rectangles, triangles, + sign, etc. 

Composition Based on Port Matching
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The Design Canvas is the place where the user performs model composition based on the port matching criterion discussed earlier. The Design Canvas ensure that only matching ports are connected via a link. It does not allow non matching ports to be connected, thereby facilitating the design – time validation of the composite solution. 

How to name the ML Model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

A model name is automatically generated when a model is dragged from the “Models” catalog palette into the Design Canvas. The user can change the name by double clicking on the existing name and overwriting on it.

How to name the Link
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Double click on the link – a text box appears, type the name of the link. 

On Click of the Model
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The model properties such as its name, owner, company, toolkit (Scikit, TensorFlow, R, etc.) are displayed in the Property box.

On Click of the Link
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The link properties such as its name appears in the Property box. 

On Hover over a Port
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The name of the operation and name of either the input or the output message, depending on the port type, pops up in Design Canvas.

On Click of the Port
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

If the user clicks on an Output (Requirement) port, then all ML Models that have the matching input (Capability) ports are displayed in the Matching Models tab.
If the user clicks on an Input (Capability) port, then all ML Models that have the matching Output (Requirement) ports are displayed in the Matching Models tab

On Click of the message
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

When the user does a mouse click on a port, then operation and message name(s) pop up. Now the user can click on the message and Protobuf message signature appears in the Property tab.

Validation Console
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When the user requests the validation of the composite solution, the Validation Console pops up from the bottom of the Design Canvas. This is where all the success and error messages related to the validation gets displayed.
