RST vs the Wiki - Which Docs Go Where
=====================================

Frequently, developers ask where documentation should be created. Should they always use reStructuredText/Sphinx? Not necessarily. Is the wiki appropriate for anything at all? Yes.

Itâ€™s really up to the development team. Here is a simple rule:

The more tightly coupled the documentation is to a particular version of the code, the more likely it is that it should be stored with the code in reStructuredText.

Two examples on opposite ends of the spectrum:

Example 1: API documentation is often stored literally as code in the form of formatted comment sections. This would be an ideal choice for reStructuredText stored in a doc repo.

Example 2: Meeting notes, release plans -- the wiki would be a better choice for this.

The Docs team encourages component teams to store as much documentation as reStructuredText as possible because:

    #. The Docs team can more easily edit component documentation for grammar, spelling, clarity, and consistency
    #. A consistent formatting syntax across components will allow the doc team more flexibility in producing different kinds of output
    #. The documentation can easily be reorganized
    #. Wiki articles tend to grow stale over time as the people who write them change positions or projects
