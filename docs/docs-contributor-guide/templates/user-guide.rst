.. If your component has a UI or needs to be configured, your component may need a User Guide.
.. Most Acumos components WILL NOT need a User Guide
.. User guide content guidelines:
.. if the guide contains sections on third-party tools, is it clearly stated why the Acumos platform is using .. .. those tools? are there instructions on how to install and configure each tool/toolset?
.. does the guide state who the target users are? for example, modeler/data scientist, Acumos platform admin, .. .. marketplace user, design studio end user, etc
.. if there are instructions, they are clear, correct, and fit for purpose
.. does the guide contain information more suited for a different guide?
.. a user guide should be how to use the component or system; it should not be a requirements document
.. a user guide should contain configuration, administration, management, using, and troubleshooting sections for .. the feature.
