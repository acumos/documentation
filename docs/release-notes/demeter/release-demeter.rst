Installation
============

Acumos provides a Zero to Acumos (Z2A) installation process for deploying to Ubuntu 20.04
development environments.  The Z2A installation covers the case of starting with a VM or the case of starting from an existing Kubernetes installation.  The Z2A was built as a modular design leveraging installation already existing for components that Acumos depends on (Nexus/MariaDB/etc.)  The mindset is for any Acumos dependency you may use your own or use the defalt that is part of the Z2A installation.
