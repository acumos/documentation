* ON-BOARDING MODEL page contains incorrect URLs:

    * **To know more about on-boarding, please have a look at** : https://docs.acumos.org/en/latest/AcumosUser/portal-user/portal/index.html should be https://docs.acumos.org/en/athena/AcumosUser/portal-user/portal/index.html
    * **Create an R model bundle** should take the user to https://docs.acumos.org/en/athena/AcumosUser/portal-user/portal/onboarding-r-guide.html

* Web On-boarding: Quit(X) is not working during and after uploading of files for web on-boarding
