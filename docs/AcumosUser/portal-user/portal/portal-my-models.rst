Viewing Your Models
===================

Users may view all the models they have uploaded by accessing the My
Models page.

Models are organized by their visibility to others on your **My Models**
page. They are sorted into the following sections: 

**MY UNPUBLISHED MODELS**
    Initially, successfully onboarded model will appear in my Models page in
    the UNPUBLISHED section. These are visible only to you and any
    collaborators of that model (shared). Partially onboarded models (in
    process) are also displayed in this section but are shown greyed out
    until the onboarding process is successfully completed.

**MY MODELS: PUBLISHED TO COMPANY MARKETPLACE**
    Models that have been published to Local, appear in the the LOCAL
    marketplace and are visible to anyone with an account on the local
    Acumos Instance.

**MY MODELS: PUBLISHED TO PUBLIC MARKETPLACE**
    Models that have been published to Public, appear in the the PUBLIC
    marketplace and may be viewed by users on Acumos instances that have a
    federated relationship with your local instance.

**MY DELETED MODELS**
    Initially, successfully onboarded model will appear in my Models page in
    the UNPUBLISHED section. These are visible only to the owner of that
    model and any collaborators of that model (via the "Share Model"
    process). Partially onboarded models (in process) are also displayed in
    this section but are shown greyed out until the onboarding process is
    successfully completed.

Clicking on any model image shows the Model Detail page for that model.
