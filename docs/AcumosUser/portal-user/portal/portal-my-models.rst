Viewing Your Models
===================

Users may view all the models they have uploaded by accessing the My
Models page.

Models are organized by their visibility to others on your **My Models**
page. They are sorted into the following sections:

**MY UNPUBLISHED MODELS**
    Initially, successfully on-boarded model will appear in my Models page in
    the UNPUBLISHED section. These are visible only to you and any
    collaborators of that model (shared). Partially on-boarded models (in
    process) are also displayed in this section but are shown greyed out
    until the on-boarding process is successfully completed.

**MY MODELS: PUBLISHED TO COMPANY MARKETPLACE**
    Models that have been published to Local, appear in the the LOCAL
    marketplace and are visible to anyone with an account on the local
    Acumos Instance.

**MY MODELS: PUBLISHED TO PUBLIC MARKETPLACE**
    Models that have been published to Public, appear in the the PUBLIC
    marketplace and may be viewed by users on Acumos instances that have a
    federated relationship with your local instance.

**MY DELETED MODELS**
    At this time, models are not truly deleted but rather moved into a "deleted" state.

1. Access the **My Models** page from the outer left menu

2-6. This functionality works the same way it does on the main Marketplace page. Please see the :doc:`../marketplace/marketplace-intro` for details.

Clicking on any model image shows the **Model Detail** page for that model.
