======================
On-Boarding an R Model
======================
.. note::
    R Client v0.2-7 was tested with the Acumos Athena platform release

Prerequisites
=============
Before you begin:

#) You must have R installed on you system. Please have a look at `cran.r-project.org <https://cran.r-project.org/>`_

#) You must have protobuf 3 installed on your system (version 2 will not work).

   .. code:: bash

    git clone https://github.com/google/protobuf.git protobuf
    cd protobuf
    ./autogen.sh
    ./configure --prefix=`pwd`/../`uname -m`-linux-gnu
    make
    make install
    cd ../..

#) You must have an Acumos account

Installing the Acumos R Client
==============================

Within R you need to install and load all dependent packages from CRAN first.

.. code:: bash

    install.packages(c("Rcpp","RCurl","RUnit","rmarkdown","knitr","pinp"))
    library(Rcpp,Rcurl,RUnit,rmarkdown,knitr,pinp)


Then Install the Acumos R Client package and RProtobuf package thanks to the following command:

.. code:: bash

    install.packages("acumos",,c("http://r.research.att.com","http://rforge.net"))


Alternatively, to install from sources:

.. code:: bash

    git clone git@github.com:s-u/acumos.git or git clone https://github.com/s-u/acumos.git
    R CMD build acumos
    R CMD INSTALL acumos_*.tar.gz


Using the Acumos R Client
=========================

Model bundle
------------

To create the model bundle, use acumos::compose() with the functions to expose.
If type specs are not defined, they default to c(x="character"). The model
bundle consists of component.json defining the component and its metadata,
component.bin the binary payload, and component.proto with the protobuf specs.
Please consult R documentation page for details, i.e., use ?compose in R or see
the `Compose <http://www.rforge.net/doc/packages/acumos/compose.html>`_ page at
RForge.

The compose function provide the model bundle as an .amc file that is in fact a zip file, you have to unzip it and zip it again to have the .zip extension.

.. code-block:: bash

    unzip component.amc
    zip component.zip component.proto component.bin meta.json

Authentication and upload
-------------------------

Once the model bundle is created, you can use the push() API to upload it in Acumos.

.. code-block:: bash

    acumos::push("url","file","username:token")

url is : http://hostname:8090/onboarding-app/v2/models

file : component.zip

username : your Acumos username

token : Authentication token available in the Acumos portal in your profile section


You can also authenticate yourself by using the auth() API:

.. code-block:: bash

    acumos::auth("url","username","password")

url is : http://hostname:8090/onboarding-app/v2/auth

username : your Acumos username

password : your Acumos password


In the Response, you will receive an authentication token to be used in the push() API:

.. code-block:: bash

    acumos::push("url","file","token")
