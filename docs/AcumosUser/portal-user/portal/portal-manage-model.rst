Managing a Model
================

If a model has not been published, the Model Detail page may not show
very much information. To add a description, documents and details from the My Models page, click on any model image to show the Model Detail page for that model. From the Model Detail Page, click on the Manage My Model button at the top. A new page loads with MANAGEMENT OPTIONS on the left.


Sharing a Model with a Team
===========================

A Modeler can share a model with anyone who has an account on his/her local
Acumos. When you share a model with a collaborator, you make that Modeler a
co-owner of the model. This means they have all the same capabilities as
the original owner. An overview is shown below.

The steps to share are as follows:

1. First, select the "Share with Team" tab under "MANAGEMENT OPTIONS"

    .. image:: ../images/portal/models_shareWithTeamTab.png

2. Next, where you see "find a user to share with", type in the user ID
   of the person you wish to share with - you will need to get that user
   ID from them. The UI will show suggestions, based on the characters
   you have typed. Once you have located the correct person, select the
   SHARE button

    .. image:: ../images/portal/models_shareWithTeamScreen.png


3. Finally, the Sharing Popup will disappear and you can see that your
   model is shared and you have added them as a collaborator for that
   model. Click on each icon to see who you are currently sharing a
   model with

    .. image:: ../images/portal/models_shareWithTeamDone.png


The new collaborator will receive a notification that a new model has
been shared with him/her.

If you wish to remove the sharing rights from someone, simply click on
the small "X" next to his/her icon.

Publishing a Model
==================

Users may distribute their model by publishing it to either their 
Company Marketplace or to the Public Marketplace.

The presentation of the model may be different in each marketplace to
meet the needs of the different communities. For example, a user may
wish to provide company-specific details to their colleagues inside
their Company instance. This may include proprietary information,
documents or details that are only relevant to colleagues using the
Company instance. Information published to Company is contained within the
company firewall.

The Modeler may wish to present their model to the Public Marketplace in a more
general way, so it can be discovered and adapted for use by others.

Acumos provides two separate publishing workflows to meet this need.

There is a facility to simply use the same information if the publication information is the same for both marketplaces. Also, publishing to
either marketplace can be done in any order. There is no requirement to
publish first to the Company marketplace. The same model can appear in
both catalogs.

Publishing to the Company Marketplace
-------------------------------------

The publishing process is summarized here.

    .. image:: ../images/portal/models_publishLocalJourney.png


Specific steps:

#. From the **My Models** page, select the model of interest, open the
   **Model Detail Page** and click on **Manage My Model** at the top
#. Select Publish to Company Marketplace
#. Click on Model Description and describe your model in terms that your
   users will understand and wish to use it
#. Click on Model Category. Select a Category and Toolkit type from the
   dropdown box
#. Select Model Documents and add any useful documents, such as release
   notes or detailed instructions that will help your users
#. Click on Model Tags. Either select one of the system tags or add your
   own. Any tags you add will become available for other users to select
   as well
#. You have completed the first step for publishing. Now click on
   **Submit for Publication**. This will launch a series of back end
   steps that will prepare your model for publication
#. The publishing workflow consists of several steps including checking
   for licences, and running a keyword and security scan. Some instances
   may require manual review
#. Once the publishing process is complete, all the workflow icons will
   be highlighted and the model will be available in the Company
   Marketplace

Publishing to the Public Marketplace
------------------------------------

Publishing to the Public Marketplace follows the same steps as Publish
to Company Marketplace except it requires the approval of a user who has the Publisher role.

The description and documentation may be different, as needed for a
different audience. If you wish to use the same presentation for the
Public model that you have previously published to Company, use the
checkbox to select that.

Once approved by a Publisher, the model will be published to the Public MarketPlace. 
A modeler can also withdraw a model from publication by clicking on **Withdraw Request** from the Publish To Public screen.
