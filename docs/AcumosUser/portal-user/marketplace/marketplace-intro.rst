Overview
========

The Acumos Marketplace is designed to make it easy to discover, explore,
and use AI models. In addition to displaying models from the local platform's catalog, the Public Marketplace can be configured to display models from peer Public Marketplaces. Users may view the details of a peer Model. However, users aren't able to work with, download, or deploy a peer Model without first requesting access to use that model. Public Marketplace peer relationships are set up and managed by the administrators of each Acumos instance.


The Marketplace has three main views:

- Company: The Company Marketplace only shows models which have been onboarded by local users and published to the local marketplace catalog
- Public: Models in the Public Marketplace are visible to all Acumos instances with a peer relationship
- ALL:  This choice displays models in both the user's Company and Public Marketplace

After you have used models on the Marketplace, you can share your experiences by using the comments and ratings capabilities on the Marketplace.
