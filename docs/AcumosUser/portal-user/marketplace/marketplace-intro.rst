Overview
========

The Acumos Marketplace is designed to make it easy to discover, explore, and
use AI models. In addition to displaying models from the local platform's
catalog, the Public Marketplace can be configured to display models from peer
Public Marketplaces. Users may view the details of a peer Model. However, users
aren't able to work with, download, or deploy a peer Model without first
requesting access to use that model. Public Marketplace peer relationships are
set up and managed by the administrators of each Acumos instance.

The Marketplace only displays Public models to users who have not logged in.
There is no option to display models from marketplaces other than Public.

The Marketplace has three main views to logged-in users:

- Company: The Company Marketplace only shows models which have been onboarded by local users and published to the local marketplace catalog
- Public: Models in the Public Marketplace are visible to all Acumos instances with a peer relationship
- ALL:  This choice displays models in both the user's Company and Public Marketplace

After you have used models on the Marketplace, you can share your experiences
by using the comments and ratings capabilities on the Marketplace.
