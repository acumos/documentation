Deploying to Azure
==================
Logged-in users may deploy a model's microservice to Microsoft Azure.

Microsoft Azure is a cloud computing service created by Microsoft for building,
testing, deploying, and managing applications and services through a global
network of Microsoft-managed data centers. Acumos is able to deploy models and
composite models easily in an Azure cloud. It creates a new virtual machine and
deploys the model in that VM.

A Composite Solution is combination of more than one model. The Model Connector
is also deployed with a composite  solutions since it is used for communication
between models in the VM. Databroker details can be specified for a composite
model. If a Data Broker image is available in the composite solution, then it
will also be deployed. Upon successful deployment, the user is notified of the model connector
endpoint and optionally, the Zip or CSV Databroker.

This guide is intended to help you:

* setup a Microsoft Azure account for use in deploying Acumos models
* access the deployed Azure VMs for testing, etc

This guide assumes that you have an Azure account. If not, you can sign up for
a free trial account at https://azure.microsoft.com.


Configuring Your Azure Account
------------------------------
This section will help you setup your Azure account for use in launching Acumos
models and save key account attributes for use in the Acumos portal "Deploy to
Cloud" dialog. A summary of the minimum attributes you will need is below,
followed by instructions on creating/obtaining these attributes.


* Application Id: "Application Id" value for your Azure Active Directory application
* Tenant Id: the "Directory ID" value under "Azure Active Directory" / "Properties"
* Secret key: application key "Value" created through "Settings" / "Keys" for your Azure Active Directory application
* Subscription Key: your "Subscription Id"
* Resource Group: Name of your Resource group
* Acr Name: Name of your Azure Container Registry (ACR)
* Storage Account: Name of your Azure Storage Account

Copy Tenant Id
..............
The Acumos platform needs your Azure account "Azure Active Directory" ID during
model launch in Azure. Note this ID is only provided by you in the "Launch in
Azure" dialog, and is not retained by the Acumos platform. To copy this ID for
later use, under "Azure Active Directory":

* select "Properties"
* copy the "Directory ID" value and save for later use as the "Tenant Id" in the "Launch in Azure" dialog

Copy Subscription Key
.....................
The Acumos platform needs your Azure account "Subscription Id" during model
launch in Azure. Note your "Subscription Id" is only provided by you in the
"Launch in Azure" dialog and is not retained by the Acumos platform. To copy
this ID for later use, under "Cost Managemen + Billing":

* select "Subscriptions"
* select "My subscriptions"
* copy your "Subscription Id" and save for later use as the "Subscription Key" in the "Launch in Azure" dialog

Create an Azure Active Directory application entry for the Acumos portal
........................................................................
As described at `here
<https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/azure-resource-manager/resource-group-cr
eate-service-principal-portal>`_, the Acumos platform represents "code that
needs to access or modify resources" in Azure, and to be given those
permissions, needs to be registered as an Azure Active Directory (AD)
application. The ID assigned to this application will be used by the Acumos
platform during model launch in Azure. Note this ID is only provided by you in
the "Launch in Azure" dialog and is not retained by the Acumos platform. To
register the Acumos platform as an application and copy its ID for later use,
under "Azure Active Directory":


* select "App registrations"
* select "+" (create new)
* enter a name
* enter any URL (this is not used for Acumos)
* set "Application type" to "Web app / API"
* select "Create"
* copy the displayed "Application Id" for later use as the "Application Id" in the "Launch in Azure" dialog

Create a Secret Key for the Azure Active Directory Application
..............................................................
The Acumos platform needs to be assigned a secret key in order to access your
Azure account during model launch in Azure. Note this secret key is only
provided by you in the "Launch in Azure" dialog and is not retained by the
Acumos platform. To create and copy this secret key for later user, under
"Azure Active Directory":

* select "App registrations"
* select the Azure Active Directory application registered above
* select "Settings"
* select "Keys"
* under "Passwords" enter a key name and duration
* select "Save"
* copy the displayed application key "Value" for later use as the "Secret Key" in the "Launch in Azure" dialog

Add Admin User permission for Your Azure Subscription
.....................................................
The Acumos platform needs to be able to create resources under your
subscription, in order to deploy models there. To enable this, you need to
assign the the Azure Active Directory application registered above with
permissions as "Contributor" and "Reader", as below. To create the needed
permissions, under "Cost Management + Billing":

* select "Subscriptions"
* select "My subscriptions"
* select your subscription
* select "Access control (IAM)"
* select "+Add"
* set "Role" to "Contributor"
* set "Assign access to" to "Azure AD user, group, or application"
* under "Select" enter the Azure Active Directory application name you created above
* select the Azure Active Directory application name when it is displayed below
* select "Save"

Repeat this process, selecting this time the "Role" as "Reader".

Note that all resources you create below will now inherit these Admin user
permissions, so you do not have to set permissions for each resource.

Create a Resource Group
.......................
Resource Groups allow management of resources with a common ("inherited") set
of permissions and other options. The Acumos platform needs the name of a
resource group under which you have created some basic resources (as described
later) during model launch in Azure. Note this Resource Group name is only
provided by you in the "Launch in Azure" dialog and is not retained by the
Acumos platform.

If you don't have an existing resource group in the East US region, you will
need to create one. To create a resource group, under "Resource groups":

* select "Create"
* enter a "Name" (you will use this name later in the "Launch in Azure" dialog)
* select "East US" (this location is currently required by the Acumos platform)
* select "Create"
* refresh the list of Resource groups and the new one should be displayed
* select the resource group

Create an Azure Container Registry (ACR)
........................................
An ACR is needed so the Acumos platform can push container images to your Azure 
account, for launch inside VMs created in the process of model deployment. 
Using an ACR under your Azure account can speed up model deployment. The Acumos 
platform needs the name of this ACR during model launch in Azure. Note this ACR 
name is only provided by you in the "Launch in Azure" dialog and is not 
retained by the Acumos platform.

If you don't have an existing ACR in the East US region, you will need to 
create one. To create a new ACR, under "All resources":


* select "+Add"
* select "Containers"
* select "Azure Container Registry"
* enter a "Name" (you will use this name later in the "Launch in Azure" dialog)
* set "Resource group" to "Use existing"
* from the drop-down list, select the resource group created above
* select "East US" (this location is currently required by the Acumos platform)
* select "Create"
 
Create a Storage Account
........................
A storage account is needed so the Acumos platform can install applications and 
save data to disk as needed during model deployment and execution. The Acumos 
platform needs the name of this storage account during model launch in Azure. 
Note the storage account name is only provided by you in the "Launch in Azure" 
dialog and is not retained by the Acumos platform.

If you don't have an existing storage account in the East US region, you will 
need to create one. To create a storage account, under "Storage accounts":

* select "+Add"
* enter a "Name" (you will use this name later in the in the "Launch in Azure" dialog)
* set "Resource group" to "Use existing"
* from the drop-down list, select the resource group created above
* select "East US" (this location is currently required by the Acumos platform)
* select "Create"

Create a Network Security Group and Access Rules
................................................
A network security group (NSG) is required so that the Acumos platform can 
configure access to necessary host ports on the deployed VMs. A specific NSG 
name is required by the Acumos platform. To create this NSG, under "Resource 
groups":

* select the resource group created above
* select "+Add"
* in the search box, enter "Security"
* in the resulting list, select "Network Security Group"
* select "Create"
* set "Name" to "E6E-NSG"
* set "Resource group" to "Use existing"
* from the drop-down list, select the resource group created above
* select "East US" (this location is currently required by the Acumos platform)
* select "Create"

To enable the Acumos platform to access VMs it deploys, deploy model 
microservices, and deploy additional components that help orchestrate and 
connect the models to your data sources, you will need to define NSG rules to 
open the following TCP ports to the Acumos platform. The Acumos platform will 
be identified here by IP address; you can get the IP address using a 
reverse-DNS lookup e.g. 'nslookup marketplace.acumos.org'. Ports that need to 
be opened, and their purpose, are described below:

* TCP port 22: SSH, enabling the Acumos platform to configure the deployed VM, e.g. install docker and the various microservices and platform components
* TCP port 8555: Acumos Blueprint Orchestrator, used in Composite Solution deployment
* TCP port 8556: Acumos DataBroker, a component deployed when a user wants assistance in mapping a data source to the protobuf interface of a deployed model (details will be provided for when this applies and how the user selects it)
* TCP port 5006: Acumos Probe, a component enabling the user to access and visualize the protobuf interfaces of their deployed solutions

If you need to provide access to your model microservices from outside the 
Azure virtual network, e.g. to push data to the microservice, you will need to 
create additional NSG rules to open the following ports to the IP addresses of 
systems to be connected to the microservices:

* TCP port 8557: microservice #1, i.e. for deployment of a single model microservice ("Simple Solution") or the first microservice in a multi-model deployment ("Composite Solution")
* TCP port 8558: microservice #2
* TCP port 8559: microservice #3
* TCP port 8560: microservice #4
* and so on

To add NSG rules, under "Resource groups":

* select the resource group created above
* select NSG "E6E-NSG"
* select "Inbound security rules"
* select "+Add"
* set "Source" to the IP address of the system that needs the access 
* select "Protocol" "TCP"
* set "Destination port ranges" to the specific port or range of ports that applies to the rule
* set "Name" to whatever helps you remember what the rule is related to
* select "Add"

Repeat this for any other hosts you want to have access to the VM, and for any 
other access rules that are needed for your deployed model or applications to 
be installed on or connected to the deployed VM.

Note: it is recommended to NOT set "Source" to "Any" and "Destination port ranges" to "*" as these settings can expose your VM to security risks.

Create a Virtual Network
........................

A virtual network and subnet is required so that required ports can be opened on the VM in which Acumos will launch your model. Acumos requires a specifically named virtual network and subnet, since it will create interfaces and public IP addresses on that network/subnet.

To create the specified virtual network, under "Resource groups":

* select the resource group created above
* select "+Add"
* enter "Networking" in the search bar and hit enter
* in the resulting list, select "Virtual network"
* select "Create"
* set "Name" to "Acumos-OAM-vnet"
* set "Resource group" to "Use existing"
* from the drop-down list, select the resource group created above
* select "East US" (this location is currently required by the Acumos platform)
* set "Subnet" to "Acumos-OAM-vsubnet"
* select "Create"

Associate the NSG to the Subnet
...............................

To ensure the NSG rules created above are applied to the subnet you created, under "Resource groups":

* select the resource group created above
* select the virtual network "Acumos-OAM-vnet"
* select "Subnets"
* select "Acumos-OAM-vnet"
* select "Network security group"
* select the NSG "E6E-NSG"
* select "Save"




Deploying Your Model
====================

#. Locate the Model Detail Page for the model of interest
#. Click on the **Deploy to Cloud** drop-down arrow and select Microsoft Azure

The resulting dialog will require the parameters listed under `Configuring Your Azure Account`_ in this guide.

#. **Application ID** The ID for  application  during  registrations in Azure Active Directory
#. **TenantID** The ID of the AAD (Azure Active Directory)  in which  application is created
#. **Secret key**  Client Secret key for a web application registered with Azure Active Directory
#. **Subscription Key** Subscription grants access to  Azure services and to the Azure Platform Management Portal
#. **Resource Group**  Resource groups provide a way to monitor, control access, provision and manage billing for collections of assets that are required to run an application, or used by a client or company department
#. **Acr Name** Same as ApplicationID
#. **Storage Account** An Azure storage account provides a unique namespace to store and access Azure Storage data objects. All objects in a storage account are billed together as a group

Click **Deploy**. The Acumos platform will create these resources under your Azure subscription:

* a NIC
* a public IP address
* a disk
* a VM

At the current time, there is no explicit notification that deployment was complete and successful. You can verify deployment success as described in the following section.

Accessing and Verifying the Deployment
--------------------------------------

The Acumos platform currently creates a single user account on the deployed VM, with these credentials:

* username: dockerUser
* password: 12NewPA$w0rd!

Cleaning up Azure Resources
===========================
The Acumos platform does not automatically remove resources that it creates 
under your Azure account. When you are done testing with the model in the 
launched VM, if you do not want to keep these resources active, you can delete 
them through the Azure "All resources" list.
