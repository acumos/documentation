On-Boarding Design Studio Toolkit Models
========================================

The Design Studio requires specific toolkit models to be on-boarded in order for
Data Broker, Generic Data Mapper, Splitter, and Collator functionality to be
enabled.

On-Boarding the Models
----------------------

#. Download the following archived model bundles from the Design Studio `wiki <https://wiki.acumos.org/display/DS#DesignStudioHome-ToolKitModels>`_ page:

    - Collator.zip
    - Splitter.zip
    - DataBroker.zip
    - DataMapper.zip

#. Each zip file is a model that needs to be on-boarded; follow the :doc:`web on-boarding <../../portal-user/portal/portal-onboarding-web>` instructions to upload the models.

Publishing the Models
---------------------
All the models should be published to the Company marketplace. Each model needs
to have Model Category and Toolkit Type set. See the *Publishing to the Company
Marketplace* section of the :doc:`../../portal-user/portal/portal-manage-model`
page in the Portal and Marketplace User Guide for instructions.
