Scripts in the misc-scripts directory
=====================================

These scripts are not part of the official documentation build or
generation process. The official documentation files must be in
reStructuredText (RST) format, and all developers should be creating project
documentation in RST. These scripts are provided as a courtesy to
developers who have existing documentation that needs to be converted to
RST.

Pandoc (https://pandoc.org/) must be installed in order to run these
scripts. Use the latest version available for your platform.
Installation instructions for Windows, Mac, and Linux can be found at
https://pandoc.org/installing.html

The generated RST file may need some clean up.
