# Acumos Documentation

Acumos documentation is stored in git repositories, changes are managed with gerrit reviews, and published documents generated when there is a change in any source used to build the documentation.

Authors create source for documents in reStructured Text (RST) that is rendered to HTML and PDF and published on Readthedocs.io. The developer Wiki or other web sites can reference these rendered documents directly allowing projects to easily maintain current release documentation.

This repository holds files needed to produce automated documentation using Sphinx
for the Acumos machine-learning platform.  

Sphinx uses reStructuredText as its markup language, and many of its strengths come from the power and straightforwardness of reStructuredText. 

Please see the documentation in the "docs" folder.
